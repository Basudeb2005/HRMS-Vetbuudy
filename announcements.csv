Dear all

 

Thank you for completing the Letter of Award (LOA) signing.  

 

The disbursement of the SGD10K by NUS Enterprise (ETP) will be provided as a lump sum to the main applicant's account within 2 to 3 weeks from today. For more information about fund utilization, please refer to the attached information sheet or visit NUS Computing - Frequently Asked Questions (Q9 to Q16). Please take note of the following:

 

All projects are required to keep track of the usage by completing the expenditure report in both the mid-term and final progress reports, along with the submission of corresponding receipts during mid-term and final reviews.
For any single item purchase exceeding SGD2K, please seek approval from your mentor before making the purchase.
 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. In the meantime, reach out to your mentors and start working on your projects!!

 

See yâ€™all on 23 Oct!

 

Regards

Vivien
